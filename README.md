Open Source Play
=====================

This is simply a list of projects to try playign with different open source projects
to evaluate their usefulness - and have a bit of fun at the same time :-)

These are all fairly simple and in no way are trying to demonstrate best practices -
they are mostly just hacked together. They can be used as a base to further explore
their capabilities of course :-)
